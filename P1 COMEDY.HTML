        ACT I
        Scene 1
        In the darkness a dog barks. Semyon can’t sleep.
        SEMYON
        Masha. Are you sleeping? Masha?
        Masha startles into wakefulness.
        MASHA
        What? !
        SEMYON
        Shhhh..it’s just me. Sorry...
        MASHA
        Semyon...
        Masha returns to an exhausted sleep.
        SEMYON
        Masha, can I ask you-- are you sleeping Masha?
        MASHA
        What?
        SEMYON
        Did we eat all the sausage?
        (Pause)
        That baloney sausage?
        MASHA
        Did you look?
        SEMYON
        It’s cold. I thought /you’d remember.
        MASHA
        You wake me in the middle of the night for baloney
        sausage?
        SEMYON
        I’m hungry.
        MASHA
        Go to sleep!
        She turns from him. He sighs. They try to settle.
        After a moment:
        (CONTINUED)
        CONTINUED: 4.
        MASHA
        You’ve killed something in me with that sausage,
        Semyon. Every day I get up in the freezing dark and
        walk to the factory. Twelve hours of mind-numbing,
        back-breaking work-- and after I get home and eat and
        fall into bed exhausted, what d’you do? Semyon...? Are
        you sleeping?
        (A snore. A slow fury ignites in Masha.)
        Semyon!
        SEMYON
        (waking with a start)
        What? !
        MASHA
        I said: let me sleep!
        SEMYON
        (puzzled)
        But/ Masha ?--
        MASHA
        But no, you’ve got to wake me for baloney sausage.
        SEMYON
        (suddenly alert)
        Oh! Is there any left?
        MASHA
        Yes, yes!-- because you didn’t eat it at supper!
        SEMYON
        I wasn’t hungry at supper.
        MASHA
        That’s why you’re hungry now.
        SEMYON
        I couldn’t eat.
        MASHA
        Mother and I go out of our way to put food on the table
        my darling/ your favourite food...
        SEMYON
        Exactly, that’s the reason I can’t eat/ exactly--
        MASHA
        We put more food on your plate than on our own--
        SEMYON
        You torment me.
        (CONTINUED)
        CONTINUED: 5.
        MASHA
        What?!
        SEMYON
        How can I eat with the two of you watching me like I’m
        some sort of parasite, starving you mouthful by
        mouthful? I’ve no job and no money, as your mother
        helpfully reminds me twenty times a day, so I don’t buy
        the food --but I still get just as hungry, and you pile
        my plate high to torment me.
        MASHA
        Now is not the time/ for this.
        Semyon lights a lamp by the bed.
        SEMYON
        Every meal is torment! I try not to eat, but then in
        the middle of the night when I’m alone in bed with you,
        dreaming and drooling about sausage--you crucify me
        /with guilt.
        MASHA
        I crucify you??
        SEMYON
        In your way/ yes--
        MASHA
        Oh climb down from the cross!
        She is getting out of bed.
        One order of baloney coming right up!
        SEMYON
        --with your psychology ...
        MASHA,
        Which would you prefer, white bread or brown?
        SEMYON
        Makes no difference because--
        MASHA
        Or cake? Baloney on cake?
        SEMYON
        --I’m not going to eat it.
        MASHA
        Oh ho, you’re going to eat it my friend.
        Masha heads to the kitchen .
        (CONTINUED)
        CONTINUED: 6.
        SEMYON
        Can’t you see what you’re doing?
        She exits.
        SEMYON
        Your psychology is killing me. ’Counselor,is Semyon
        Podeskalnikov a man or a maggot?’ After careful
        consideration, the jury concludes: he’s/ a--
        Masha returns with a half-eaten BALONEY sausage
        and a crust of bread.
        MASHA
        Maggot! Dinner is served my lord maggot.
        SEMYON
        Not hungry.
        MASHA
        You’ll eat this if /I have to
        SEMOYON
        Please/
        MASHA
        --stuff it down your /throat.
        SEMYON
        Let go woman/ you’re going to--
        MASHA
        Eat! Eat your face off /you lazy--
        SEMYON
        Argh!
        They struggle over the plate and it goes flying
        with a crash.The dog outside barks. In their
        respective rooms off, Yegor and Serafima stir.
        YEGOR
        Keep it quiet down there! /Workers are sleeping!
        SERAFIMA
        (calling)
        Masha--?
        They stop as if the Yegor is the House Authority.
        SEMYON
        (lowering his voice angrily)
        (MORE)
        (CONTINUED)
        CONTINUED: 7.
        SEMYON (cont’d)
        You think you can boss me around because you wear the
        pants in this house. All right, this hallway. And it’s
        killing me.
        MASHA
        You’re just hungry Semyon.
        SEMYON
        (a decision)
        Look.I’m going to show you.
        Semyon sits on the edge of the bed, throwing off
        his blankets. He crosses his legs. He hits his
        knee with the side of his hand. His right arm
        jerks up in a reflex action and drops to hit his
        face. Repeat to show it isn’t a freak occurrence.
        It never used to happen.
        MASHA
        Maybe you could get a job at a circus--
        SEMYON
        I wasn’t going to tell you because--
        MASHA
        --a traveling circus, preferably...
        SEMYON
        (forgets to lower his voice)
        I’m falling apart Masha!
        MASHA
        (forgets to lower her voice)
        You’re falling apart? You’re falling apart?
        SEMYON
        I thought you’d care!
        MASHA
        I can’t go on.
        SEMYON
        What do you mean?
        MASHA
        This is no way to live...
        SEMYON
        You mean you want to be set free. ’Get rid of Semyon’.
        Which would you prefer:I cut my throat or hang myself?
        (CONTINUED)
        CONTINUED: 8.
        MASHA
        Lord God spare me!
        SEMYON
        If you had three wishes,the first would be:"Semyon
        dies!"!
        MASHA
        May be!- right at this moment--
        SEMYON
        "I’d do better without Semyon, get rid of him"...
        MASHA
        It’s hard to disagree.
        Semyon blows out the lamp. Pause.
        SEMYON
        Bitch.
        MASHA
        Baloney!
        As Masha yells, they pound each other with
        pillows. Above, Yegor sticks his head out of his
        apartment in his disheveled sleeping gown. He
        blows a whistle.
        YEGOR
        Keep it quiet down there! Quiet!
        They stop as if the School Principal has spoken.
        SEMYON
        Good bye Masha. I hope you’ll be very happy.
        Pause. Then three girls with a bottle of vodka
        burst out of Alexander’s room, next to Yegor’s.
        SONIA
        (giggling)
        Goodnight comrades! If you’re bored, come join us!
        YEGOR
        Quiet! Quiet!
        {NATASHA
        You keep it quiet!
        {GRUSHA
        Party at Sonia’s!

        CONTINUED: 9.
        YEGOR
        I work in three hours!
        MASHA
        I work in two.
        GRUSHA
        We’re working now my da-a-rling.
        YEGOR
        Precisely! I’ll report you to the housing committee
        Kalabushkin! And I’ll report you Podsekalnikovs for
        conjugal activities in the hallway!
        The girls clatter down the stairs and leer at
        Masha in her bed.
        MASHA
        This is my bedroom.
        The girls exit still mocking Yegor; he slams his
        door. Quiet reigns.
        MASHA
        Semyon? I can’t sleep angry...Are you...? Why did you
        say goodbye instead of goodnight?...Semyon?
        Masha feels her way through the darkness as
        Serafima, Masha’s mother enters.
        Listen, whatever I said, I didn’t mean it...where are
        you? I’m sorry my darling...
        SERAFIMA
        (whisper)
        Masha?
        MASHA
        Mother! What are you doing here?
        SERAFIMA
        You know I never interfere Masha, but the walls are
        --well,there are no walls-- What’s the matter?
        MASHA
        Semyon was hungry.
        SERAFIMA
        What’d he do /now?
        MASHA
        Nothing! I can’t find him.
        (CONTINUED)
        CONTINUED: 10.
        SERAFIMA
        (addresses the dark room)
        Well done, comrade hero-- you’ve made your wife cry/
        you useless worm--.
        MASHA
        (tearfully)
        I’m not! Mother!
        SERAFIMA
        --come out and face her!
        Silence.
        MASHA
        Where are you? Senyechka...??Say something...
        Silence. Serafima baits Semyon
        SERAFIMA
        Oh well, he’s dropped dead.
        MASHA
        Merciful God, he’s gone to kill himself. Mother! Find
        the lamp.
        Masha feels around in the darkness. Serafima drops
        to her knees and gropes about.
        Semyon, please. I didn’t mean it. Talk to me for God’s
        sake.
        There’s a loud crack
        SERAFIMA
        Ow!
        MASHA
        What was that?
        SERAFIMA
        (controlled)
        The chair, Masha, my head against the chair.
        MASHA
        Good! The lamp’s there; quickly, light it!
        Serafima lights the lamp. Masha looks around.
        MASHA
        He’s gone.
        (CONTINUED)
        CONTINUED: 11.
        SERAFIMA
        Gone where at this time of night?
        MASHA
        I think he’s gone to kill himself.
        SERAFIMA
        Lord help us.
        MASHA
        He said I was killing him, I laughed and now he’s gone
        to do it himself!
        SERAFIMA
        It’s a nightmare.
        MASHA
        I’ve got to find him. Where’s my skirt?
        SERAFIMA
        Here are his pants./Allelujah!
        MASHA
        I don’t need his pants Mother (she realises) Oh /you
        mean --
        SERAFIMA
        Would any self-respecting Russian man leave the house
        without pants--?
        MASHA
        Then he must be--?
        SERAFIMA
        In the bathroom--
        MASHA
        Opening a vein!
        Masha takes the lamp from Serafima, runs for the
        bathroom.
        SERAFIMA
        Dear God, a suicide in the family.
        Masha runs up the stairs which lead up to the next
        landing, on which there are doors to the bathroom
        and Alexander’s room. The stairs continue up to
        Yegor’s attic. Masha tries the bathroom door--
        it’s locked.
        (CONTINUED)
        CONTINUED: 12.
        MASHA
        Semyon, open the door. Open up, come on. Talk to me !
        Below, Serafima lights another lamp under an icon.
        SERAFIMA
        Help us blessed mothers of Uutivan, of Vatapad, of
        Kupiatist, of Novo-nikito,speak to my son-in-law...
        MASHA
        (calling down)
        He’s locked the door
        SERAFIMA
        What’s he say? /(murmurs)Holy Virgin of Vydropus, of
        Smolensk..
        MASHA
        Nothing. He won’t answer. What if he’s dead already?
        SERAFIMA
        I’ll kill him. /(murmurs) Dear Virgin of Pskov..
        MASHA
        I’m going to wake Alexander Kalabushkin.
        SERAFIMA
        You can’t! He buried his mother last week--
        MASHA
        He runs the "Test Your Strength" booth at the
        fairground-- he can break the door down.
        SERAFIMA
        -- he’s in mourning. /(murmurs) Mother of Sviagorsk,/
        of Abalata-Znamenie, Blessed Virgin of Kazan...
        MASHA
        Then he’ll understand compassion. I can’t do
        it myself, I need a man.
        Masha goes to Alexander’s door and knocks. The
        lazzo of unintended sexual innuendo.
        SERAFIMA
        -- let Alexander Kalabushkin teach my son in law a
        lesson/ let his muscles ripple in his little white
        shirt as he seizes the cowering Semyon Semyonovitch ...
        SERAFIMA continues murmuring under the scene at
        the door:’let him black his eye oh Mother of
        Ibirsk, break both his legs Saint Sarah of
        Pimenov, make him crawl oh Virgin of Camargue..."

        ALEXANDER (OFF)
        Take a cold shower Comrade!
        MASHA
        Please, I’m only a woman, what can I do? I need your
        strong arms --right now, right now!
        MARGARITA
        Alexander and I are sitting here in deep
        mourning/Where’s your sense of decency?
        ALEXANDER
        Grieving! We’re grieving!
        Masha knocks harder.
        MASHA
        I’m desperate for a strong man/--please, please
        Alexander Kalabushkin/--
        MARGARITA
        Desperate!?
        Masha knocks harder.
        MASHA
        --I’m at the end of my rope!I have to break down the
        door!
        MARGARITA
        Break down the door! You ladies man...
        Suddenly Masha doesn’t know what to do.
        MASHA
        Wha--? Not this door- I’m a married woman!I’m--
        The door opens to reveal Margarita in a sleazy
        kimono, awry, with an unlit cigarette.
        MARGARITA
        Aren’t we all?
        MASHA
        I need Comrade Kalabushkin/ quickly, quickly.
        ALEXANDER
        But Sweetheart,what about your husband?

        MASHA
        He’s locked himself in the bathroom, he’s trying to
        kill himself.
        ALEXANDER
        Why didn’t you say--?
        He speeds past Margarita to the bathroom door.
        Masha follows. The lazzo of mistaking the hidden
        listener.
        MARGARITA
        The bathroom?
        SERAFIMA
        No pants.
        ALEXANDER
        (knocking)
        Hey pal; are you all right in there?
        Pause. Casual:
        What ya doin’ ?
        MARGARITA
        So: knock it down.
        ALEXANDER
        Shh ...
        MASHA
        What’s he waiting for?
        SERAFIMA
        A shot.
        Alexander recoils
        ALEXANDER
        He’s got a gun?
        SERAFIMA
        We don’t know.
        MASHA
        Should we call the police?
        MARGARITA AND ALEXANDER
        No police.
        ALEXANDER
        Say something sweet to him, and while he’s distracted
        I’ll- (He mimes.)
        (CONTINUED)
        CONTINUED: 15.
        MASHA
        Darling it’s me, Masha. I love you!
        Alexander prepares himself to break down the door.
        He slowly approaches it followed by Masha,
        Serafima, and Margarita.
        Suddenly, a chain flushes and the door flies open.
        Yegor Timofeevich comes flying out in his
        sleepwear. He sees them and scowls.
        YEGOR
        Can’t a constipated comrade take a dump in the night
        without the whole building taking notes?
        He retrieves his newspaper, stomps up to the attic
        MASHA
        I’m sorry, comrade!
        (to Serafima)
        It’s your fault, you said he was in the toilet. He must
        have gone outside!
        SERAFIMA
        Without his pants? Here, comrades, are his very pants.
        MARGARITA
        Did you check the kitchen?
        MASHA
        The kitchen!
        Masha runs out; Alexander and Margarita follow but
        Alexander holds her back.
        ALEXANDER
        Go home.
        MARGARITA
        Charming.
        ALEXANDER
        This is none of your business.
        A sound like a gun crack. Serafima screams.
        Alexander speaks to Serafima then Margarita.
        Wait! Go!
        He exits like a bat out of hell towards the sound.
        SERAFIMA
        Mother of God, he shot himself.
        (CONTINUED)
        CONTINUED: 16.
        MARGARITA
        None of my business.
        Margarita loiters.
        SERAFIMA
        I saw a lot of death in the war--
        MARGARITA
        I was smart, stayed home.
        SERAFIMA
        --but this is shameful.
        MARGARITA
        Shame is stupid.
        SERAFIMA
        Too smart is stupid.
        Enter Alexander,pulling the struggling Semyon by
        the feet.
        SEMYON
        Masha! / Let me go Alexander Kalabushkin!?
        SERAFIMA
        Ha! Dragged like the rat he is!
        ALEXANDER
        (to Serafima)
        Your daughter’s on the kitchen floor.
        Serafima and Margarita are horrified.
        MARGARITA
        What did you do?
        SEMYON
        She ran into the cupboard door.
        Serafima and Margarita exit to the kitchen.Lazzo
        of sexual misunderstanding.
        SEMYON
        Masha’s hurt--!Why are you--? Get your hand out of my
        pocket!
        Alexander immobilises Semyon.
        ALEXANDER
        I’m your friend Semyon!

        But... Masha’s my wife.
        Alexander immobilises Semyon again.
        ALEXANDER
        But I am your Friend.
        SEMYOPN
        What are you doing? Let go of me!
        ALEXANDER
        Listen to me!
        SEMYON
        But Masha--!
        Alexander adjusts his hold on Semyon
        ALEXANDER
        Masha wants you to listen. Pretend I’m her and I’ll
        give you a tax free cigar.
        SEMYON
        Talk fast...
        Alexander releases Semyon from his wrestling hold
        and gives him a cigar.
        ALEXANDER
        Think of how you are loved, Semyon,how you are needed!
        SEMYON
        Well I...Alexander, this is.../ I do! But--
        ALEXANDER
        No no, I’m asking you, as a friend--
        SEMYON
        --a neighbour--
        ALEXANDER
        --as a dear friend, Semyon Semyonovich, to really
        listen...
        SEMYON
        I’ll listen.
        ALEXANDER
        It’s so hard... (Semyon nods, concerned) I’m going to
        say something... meaningful.
        (CONTINUED)

        SEMYON
        All right.
        Lazzo of the inverted persuasion.
        ALEXANDER
        Look at this world. This...beautiful world.
        Alexander indicates the apartment, the grey dawn.
        Life is a wonderful gift, Semyon.
        SEMYON
        Mm hmm...
        ALEXANDER
        A miracle, full of wonder.
        SEMYON
        If you say so.
        ALEXANDER
        Here you are, at the revolutionary dawn of a brave new
        age. Age of industry and the working man. Age of
        the electrical machine and business opportunity--
        SEMYON
        Age of being cut off for unpaid bills.
        ALEXANDER
        God, I know! It’s like the Dark Ages! Did I tell you I
        stood in line every day,for three weeks to get them to
        get them to change that bill? It was their mistake, but
        naturally, it’s the small businessman who suffers.
        Cigar trade: they all want a cut!--and I ask myself:
        "is it worth it? Is this all there is?"
        SEMYON
        I know.
        ALEXANDER
        Some bureaucrat in a heated office hitting me with this
        regulation and that regulation: "your shooting gallery
        needs a license"; "you can’t travel without a permit";
        "Mr. Kalabushkin, where’s your identity card?". I go
        from desk to desk, fill out form after form and, as the
        line stretches into eternity, I realize I’m going to
        die waiting to live.
        SEMYON
        I know.
        Alexander pulls himself back.
        (CONTINUED)

        But life is beautiful, comrade. I read it in Pravda,
        the state newspaper/ and...
        SEMYON
        And Pravda will retract it soon.
        ALEXANDER
        Ha ha.You think too much.
        SEMYON
        I’m unemployed.
        ALEXANDER
        Tough.
        SEMYON
        I know men with two jobs. Why’s there no work for me?
        ALEXANDER
        You gotta make your own work pal.
        SEMYON
        Amazing! The same thought hit me when you were dragging
        me across the floor: "Make Your Own Work"! And that
        exact moment, my fingers touched this booklet propping
        up the kitchen table! It’s... like destiny.
        ALEXANDER
        What is ?
        SEMYON
        This manual for playing the tuba.
        ALEXANDER
        The tuba.
        SEMYON
        Look: you can learn in only twenty lessons.
        ALEXANDER
        (reading)
        ’For the first time I, Theodor Hugo Schultz, celebrated
        master of music, share my knowledge with the masses.’
        SEMYON
        Twenty concerts a month at five rubles a shot, plus
        tips -
        ALEXANDER
        That’s a lot of cash.

        I’ve got the will, I’ve got the time, I’ve got the
        manual; all I need is the tuba.
        ALEXANDER
        So, with this tuba-destiny, life’s worth living?
        SEMYON
        Yes.
        ALEXANDER
        Then you do agree that life is worth living?
        SEMYON
        Yes.
        ALEXANDER
        Right pal, give me the gun.
        SEMYON
        What gun?
        ALEXANDER
        The gun you were putting in your mouth when I came into
        the kitchen.
        SEMYON
        You’re kidding me.
        ALEXANDER
        You were going to shoot yourself.
        SEMYON
        Why?
        Lazzo of the unthinking betrayal of dangerous
        secrets.
        ALEXANDER
        Oh come on, that mother-in-law for one thing. How d’you
        stand it? And living off Masha? Watching her work;
        seeing her trapped and old before her time - you must
        feel terrible.
        SEMYON
        How d’you know all this??

        SEMYON
        Give up.
        ALEXANDER
        Give me the gun first.
        SEMYON
        You’re crazy! Where’d I get a gun?
        AJEXANDER
        Panfidich traded his razor for one at Borzov’s.
        SEMYON
        Borzov’s round the corner?
        AJEXANDER
        Yeah. No license of course. But if you’re just using it
        the once, why would you care?
        Semyon suddenly starts rummaging through his
        belongings.
        What’re you doing?
        Semyon finds a razor and holds it aloft
        SEMYON
        My father’s razor. Swedish steel.
        Semyon threatens Alexander with the razor
        ALEXANDER
        Semyon, I beg you: think how life is--
        SEMYON
        Beautiful! You showed me the light Alexander, thank
        you! By the way-- here’s my gun.
        Semyon tosses the baloney sausage at Alexander,
        then exits out of the window.
        ALEXANDER
        If you wake Borzov at this hour, he’ll murder you!

        Margarita enter, with the semi-conscious Masha.
        SERAFIMA
        Don’t drag her, she’s not a sack.
        MARGARITA
        She’s a dead-weight.
        SERAFIMA
        Get her thighs.
        MARGARITA
        I’ve got her thighs.
        ALEXANDER
        Ladies. Let me.
        Alexander lifts Masha and places her on the bed.
        She’s going to have a big lump on her head.
        She stirs.
        SERAFIMA
        She needs air. Unbutton her--
        Alexander grins and flexes his fingers.
        MARGARITA AND SERAFIMA
        I’ll do it.
        MASHA
        Semyon? Is he dead?
        ALEXANDER
        Not yet. But I have to tell you, he’s quite determined.
        MASHA
        Where is he?
        ALEXANDER
        Gone into the night.

        Wait! What if he comes back before you do? What do I

        Masha, Alexander and Marguerita exit
        SERAFIMA
        I don’t know any jokes.
        Serafima is alone. She hugs Semyon’s pants
        fearfully. Semyon re-enters through the window and
        she hides in panic. He takes a package out of his
        pocket and unwraps it: Serafima sees a gun.He
        loads it with bullets then takes up pen and paper.

        During war-time we had a prisoner in our village jail:
        not a word of Russian; little tiny guy-- and of course,
        he was shell-shocked. His head shook all the time like
        this.
        Serafima demonstrates the head shaking.Semyon
        clenches his teeth.
        SEMYON
        I’m busy!
        SERAFIMA
        It was so comical! So, one night, we all went to the
        jail with bread and meat jelly, saying "are you
        hungry?" Well, of course he was starving-- but his
        head’s going like this from side to side like he’s
        saying "no, not hungry, no".
        SEMYON
        That’s horrible!
        Semyon crumples a sheet of paper and starts over.
        SERAFIMA
        ..."Are you sure?"; "No no no"/ "Shall we leave the
        food here?"; "No!"...
        Serafima roars with laughter.
        SEMYON
        For pity’s sake! Will you shut / up?
        Semyon starts throwing crumpled paper at her.
        Serafima goes up to the bathroom. She stops.
        SERAFIMA
        Did you hear the one about Alexander the Great and the
        Jews?
        SEMYON
        Get out! OUT!!
        Serafima exits.Semyon returns to his
        letter.Reads.
        ’In the event of my death, no one is to blame. Signed,
        Semyon Semyonovich Podsekalnikov.’

        Semyon puts the gun to his temple and closes his
        eyes. He lowers it. He puts the gun in his mouth
        and closes his eyes. He lowers it. He puts the gun
        to his heart. He rocks with despair. In the
        distance we hear a mournful tuba. As he listens
        other instruments join in until a fast uplifting
        number accelerates. Musicians of the gypsy band
        march on stage to deliver the tuba to Semyon.
        Act Two
        In the Podeskalnikov hallway. Semyon sits on a
        stool, holding the tuba,the manual open in front
        of him. Masha and Serafima hover anxiously.
        SEMYON
        ’Chapter one. How to play. The tuba is played with
        three fingers. Put the first finger on the first valve,
        the second finger on the second valve and the third
        finger on the third valve.’
        He looks up, holding his position.
        How’s this?

        ’Upon blowing into the mouthpiece, the note "B" is

        Semyon blows. He blows again. Nothing.
        It’s not working. Why isn’t it working?
        Masha crosses her fingers behind her back.
        Serafima prays.The lazzo of the pretentious
        musician.
        SEMYON
        Wait, the next chapter is ’How To Blow.’
        MASHA
        You look like a natural. You hold that tuba so well!

        ’In order to blow properly, I, Theodor Hugo Schultz,
        internationally renowned Concert Tubist, suggest this
        simple and economical method. ’Tear off a little piece

        Masha does so. Semyon mumbles unintelligibly.
        MASHA
        Sorry?
        More unintelligible mumbling. Masha looks blank.
        Semyon spits out the paper, irritated.
        SEMYON
        Read the next instruction, please.
        Semyon puts another piece of paper in his mouth.

        ’Then spit the paper on the floor. While
        spitting, memorise the position of your mouth then
        blow just like you spit.’
        Semyon prepares himself. He spits. Without moving
        his mouth, he puts it over the mouthpiece. He
        blows. Nothing.
        MASHA
        Dear God in Heaven, if you exist, let him make a

        toilets so you can have your tuba, you want her to ’get
        out’ too? If you died, Semyon, if you died, we are the

        "No one is to blame?!" Of course someone’s to blame! My
        dear boy, you are so right to take leave of your life.
        It’s not worth living; of course it’s not; it must be
        simply horrifying. And someone is to blame. I cannot
        name them but, as a dead man, you can do so. Semyon,
        tell me fearlessly, who do you blame?
        SEMYON
        Theodor Hugo Schultz.
        ARISTARKH
        Schultz. I don’t know him personally-- is he a
        Comintern man?
        (he shudders)
        I think they’re all to blame; We thinkers have been
        silenced-- silenced like white slaves in
        the proletariat’s harem... Thus, as an intellectual,
        you want to die quid pro quo don’t you? Speaking for

        Think, think Semyon! The controls, the
        financing,the systemic corruption, the rationing, the
        grinding unemployment,and your social despair. Are
        these things your creation? Are they your destiny? No,
        they result from particular political and economical
        machinations. And who is necessary to save Mother
        Russia from these machinations?

        Intellectuals...?

        Bravo! Bravo Semyon; I see intelligence shining in your
        eyes. I know you want to die a meaningful, heroic
        death, admired by nation and family...
        SEMYON
        It does sound good.
        ARISTARKH
        Then act quickly. Tear up this worthless note and write
        another. Accuse them, blame them, speak your heart.
        SEMYON
        Blame the intellectuals.
        ARISTARKH
        No! - defend us! Defend! And perhaps end by asking:
        why a loyal citizen like
        (he gives a small bow)
        Aristarkh Dominikovich Grande-Skubnik has not been

        your note, I will personally ensure that it will be
        read across Russia.

        Pause. Semyon is gazing at her. Alexander
        struggles to hold her up as she poses.
        SEMYON
        Oui...
        KLEOPATRA
        Excuse my clandestine arrival...
        ALEXANDER
        Kiki, clandestine is extra.
        Kleopatra reluctantly pays more. Alexander winks
        at Semyon and goes.
        KLEOPATRA
        I’m Kleopatra Maximovna.Kiki. I know all about you.So
        tragic and so brave. I beg you; on my knees I implore
        you: do not throw away your beautiful life.
        SEMYON
        (modest)
        Oh...
        KLEOPATRA
        We are so similar, Comrade Potsen--Pidsuk--
        SEMYON
        Podsekalnikov, Semyon.
        KLEOPATRA
        So similar, I’m inspired to ask an intimate favour.

        SEMYON
        Please.
        KLEOPATRA
        You are a man of great soul. Most men look at me and
        they just see a face, they see Kleopatra Maximovna;
        face, face, face, and when they pursue me they just
        want my body, they want to take my body and make love
        to it as if my body was just a body alone without a
        thinking, feeling soul-- but Semyon, you are not like
        that, are you?
        SEMYON
        No. No, definitely.
        KLEOPATRA
        My mother was a gypsy.She went mad; I’m not ashamed. I
        grew up wild, slender as a birch tree, free as the
        wind...All my life, I’ve searched for the man who would
        understand my soul and now I think I’ve found him,
        found him in you, but it’s too late - you are to die in
        this cruel way./ You are to kill yourself.
        SEMYON
        Yes... But maybe not yet...
        Yegor emerges from his room and watches the scene.
        KLEOPATRA
        Look in my eyes. Take my hands. Love is agony.
        SEMYON
        Yes...
        KLEOPATRA
        Can you feel it? Beating here?
        SEMYON
        Yes.
        KLEOPATRA
        Even in our time, when love is despised, trampled by
        the poets with their formalist nonsense, it beats!
        Don’t kiss me- .
        SEMYON
        Sorry--
        KLEOPATRA
        --I ask this small favour: kill yourself for the one
        woman who understands the love in your soul. Kill
        yourself for Kleopatra: for Kiki and for love. Lovers
        will sob upon your grave. We will carry your coffin
        draped with flowers...

        Yes! Love! Will you promise yourself to me?
        SEMYON
        I’m sort of committed -
        KLEOPATRA
        We are both in chains. Write about it. Write how you
        feel...
        Kleopatra is giving him little kisses on the face
        SEMYON
        But um--
        KLEOPATRA
        Say you die for despair that you will never be worthy
        of me. Then Viktor Viktorivich will dump her, because
        he will see me for what I am, because he is an aesthete
        while she is a bitch.
        SEMYON
        Who?
        KLEOPATRA
        Raisa Filipovna. She wants his body, only his body,
        while I adore his soul... Defend the soul, M’sieur

        Semyon tries to indicate to Masha that he doesn’t
        know why Kiki is kissing him. He pushes Kleopatra
        into the room and holds the door shut. Masha is
        aghast. Through the following Kiki is trying to
        get through the door as Semyon holds it shut.

        Alexander takes the phone and hangs it up. All
        exhale.Semyon slumps.Viktor speaks aside to Yegor.
        VIKTOR
        A word isn’t a sparrow Comrade. You let it out, you
        can’t catch it and for that they catch you and don’t
        let you out".
        ARISTARKH
        Time marches on, comrade. Be so good as to select your
        Cause.
        Victor takes dictation.Semyon, unaware, speaks
        simply.
        SEMYON
        Thank you, all of you, for coming to my party. I
        thought I was alone but you’ve shown me that you
        care. Asking, ’what d’ you think Semyon?’, ’how d’ you
        feel...?
        To my surprise, dear comrades, I’m going to die. Me,
        Semyon, tonight... heading west as they say, setting
        sail... (The clock begins to strike twelve)... My
        boat’s called in and I’m answering the call. For all of
        us. Life?! I demand satisfaction.
        A deathly hush. Viktor has been unable to take
        dictation but Semyon signs his name anyway. He
        holds his gun with one hand,picks up his bottle
        with the other and lifts it in a toast. He bows.
        He exits.

        Everyone applauds- except Alexander and Margarita
        who look at one another with concern, and Serafima
        who is puzzled.

        I’ll go look after him.
        Alexander goes after Semyon.
        We hear a distant gunshot. Reactions range from
        shock (Serafima) to concerned (Margarita, the band
        and the girls) to relieved (everyone but Yelpidy
        who has drunk himself unconscious).
        ARISTARKH
        Gentlemen - that’s to say, people, and women - I see no
        reason why our friend could not be a man of many
        parts: poet and lover, Intellectual, womens’ rights
        activist, representative of the people,

        even a church disciple...
        (Aristarkh raises his glass)
        To Semyon Podeskalnikov...let us unite in his memory.
        The band play a dirge. Viktor, Aristarkh,
        Raisa,and Kleopatra confer. Serafima stands
        slowly. The scene changes about her and the band
        as she sings.

        Masha...
        MASHA
        Mother don’t criticise! I took a vow "till death do us

        Yes.
        MASHA
        Semyon’s not a dead weight.

        No.
        MASHA
        He’ll find a job.
        SERAFIMA
        Not where he is.
        MASHA
        Where is Semyon?
        Serafima avoids. Masha sees the note Semyon wrote
        earlier. She picks it up and reads.
        In the event of my death, no-one is to blame.

        YELPIDY
        The children’s daddy.

        Quite far, under a tree. We will mark that tree, for he

        They stand back respectfully. AlexanderViktor
        enter, carrying Semyon’s body. Margarita and Yegor
        follow; Yegor carries the gun. Semyon has a wound

        today.

        Masha lies next to Semyon. He cuddles up in the
        same way as at the top of the show. She is

        drank more. One thought crashed through me: ’find
        Masha; get her back’. Run, run, run. Hit a tree.
        Stars... Drink more. One arm hugs the tree the other
        holds the gun at my head...but no it’s the bottle
        so drink more ’til the stars burst and stream in

        He’s not ready yet. He’s not...dressed.
        She shoves Raisa’s package at Semyon. He quickly
        puts on the gold epauletted jacket and smiles at
        them. Oleg and Stepan find this odd.
        STEPAN
        We’re supposed to lift him in for you.
        SEMYON
        No thanks.
        STEPAN
        It’s part of the service.

        Semyon avoids it and Masha takes it.
        And there for all the furbelows.
        She signs again.Stepan regards the coffin.
        STEPAN
        Must have been a Party member or something big.

        No need; they’ll kill him. Holy Virgin, pray for us!
        Aristarkh, Yelpidy and Viktor enter. Masha and

        panics. He jumps into the coffin and lies there,
        as if dead.
        MASHA
        Gentlemen.Comrades.There’s been a terrible mistake. He
        isn’t dead. There’s been a ... a drinking error. He’s

        VIKTOR
        Yes, a People’s Commissar would have fitted the bill
        much better. He’s so common and idiotic-looking, like a
        rooster.
        Viktor messes with Semyon’s collar and hair.
        ARISTARKH
        Precisely: what can one say was remarkable about
        such an ugly fellow? Look at his nose.
        VIKTOR
        The old woman did a terrible job with his hair.
        ARISTARKH
        Perhaps we emphasize his masculinity to distract?

        Pad him out you mean? I have spare socks somewhere.

        Ugly, common and stupid. Three in one! But mild
        compared to Serafima on a Sunday. It’s nothing new.

        There’s nothing new under the sun. So here’s for
        nothing:are you ready this time? ’Yes I’m ready’. On my
        count? ’On your count’...

        SEMYON
        You don’t mean it comrades;/ You’ll forgive me!
        Semyon carefully puts down the gun.
        A VOICE
        Shoot him!
        Voices yell in agreement. Semyon runs and everyone
        but Alexander and Margarita pursue. The crowd
        corner Semyon. Viktor raises the gun to shoot him,
        then locks eyes with Aristarkh.
        ARISTARKH
        Should the funeral proceed as planned?
        VOICES
        Yes! Shoot him!

        To love!
        VOICE
        Traitor to the Revolution!
        SEMYON
        No Comrades -- I demand a final word!
        (they agree)
        I did NOT run away from the October Revolution.
        Maybe I didn’t go out the house the entire month, but
        I didn’t run away.
        MASHA
        It’s true!
        SEMYON
        When the Revolution asked, my right hand went up! When
        it came to war, when it came to jobs, even when it
        voted against me, my right hand stayed up. I stuck it
        out, comrades, for years I stuck it out...
        MASHA
        It’s true!
        SEMYON
        And now I want to ask the Revolution, "what more d’you
        want of me?" I never did a thing against our
        Revolution.
        NATASHA
        You criticised the Kremlin.
        SEMYON
        I was drunk!
        ARISTARKH
        True, but consider that what might be proper
        when expressed in a dead man’s obituary is nonetheless
        improper when he shouts it over the telephone to the
        Kremlin!
        SEMYON
        Then I’ll whisper it. What harm is a whisper? Even if
        we’re alive and sober, can’t we whisper Comrades? We
        want bread, we want jobs, we want a voice...because
        when we say ’life is hard’, it gets easier.
        OLEG
        Life is hard/Comrade.

        GRUSHA
        More bread /would help.
        NATASHA
        More money/ would help.

        Vodka.
        ARISTARKH
        It is a crime to put Individual Wants before the good
        of Society.
        SEMYON
        Oh, guilty,guilty! But Society, Comrade, what’s that? A
        factory for slogans! When our government puts out signs
        saying "for everyone, for everyone" I don’t even look
        any more. I know it means for everyone but me. Once
        upon a time I was a man,comrades, I was a cog in the
        machine, but now!-- you’re looking at a spare part.
        Hosanna! You can take your scientific construction of
        society, your achievements, your world conquests,
        Comrades. I’m not asking for much. Just a living wage
        and a peaceful life in a hallway with Masha and her
        mother, and those two; hell, even Yegor. I’ll live for
        them, not die for you.
        YELPIDY
        You rob the kingdom of heaven for Earthly Delight.
        SEMYON
        What earthly delight? Life is hard! And about to get
        harder because I’m going to pay your money back, every
        kopek.
        MASHA
        We’ll work for you.
        SEMYON
        I’ll play the tuba for you. I’ll send my mother in law
        down the salt mines.
        SERAFIMA
        You don’t scare me.
        SEMYON
        I’m not the hero to get your slogan factory going.
        Forgive me.
        Accepting defeat, Viktor lowers the gun.

        Viktor Viktorovich! You are magnificent in action.
        VIKTOR
        Kiki, you smell like Paris.
        Kleopatra and Viktor embrace, reunited. Masha goes
        to Semyon.
        RAISA
        Oh for...Get me a drink.

        Masha and Semyon embrace.
        MARGARITA
        (to Alexander)
        I’m feeling very sad.
        ALEXANDER
        The future holds some serious grieving.

        ’To us has come our very own Semyon’--alive!
        Grusha, Sonia and Natasha break out drinks.The
        band find their instruments.Sonia picks up a
        message from a musician and gives it to Oleg.
        MARGARITA
        Speech! Speech!
        SEMYON
        Human life is strange and curious, Comrades. How did we
        get here? And what are we doing?
        OLEG
        Wasting a perfectly good coffin!
        Off stage, a loud gun shot is heard.
        STEPAN
        Maybe not, comrade.
        (A note flutters down from the sky.
        Stepan opens it)
        This just in from Eternity.
        (CONTINUED)

        OLEG
        A suicide! A real one this time?
        STEPAN
        It seems that Yegor-- that little post man?--he just
        shot himself.
        MASHA
        No. /No!
        STEPAN
        Following your/ example.
        SERAFIMA
        Holy God, why?
        SEMYON
        Why?
        NATASHA
        From us has gone our very own Yegor.
        The End.</p>
